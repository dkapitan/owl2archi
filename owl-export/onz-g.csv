Our definition of case roles follows the theory of the linguist Charles Fillmore. In short, case roles describe what role some entity plays in an event,  e.g. if it is doing something, undergoing something or using something. In this ontology, we use case role as a specification of the general role Participant.

For example, in the sentence 'Mary hit John with vase', we have three participants: Mary, John and a vase. With case roles, you can specify the semantic role of the participants:  'Mary' is the Agent, 'John' the Patient and 'the vase' the Theme.

Having case roles for participants of an event allows for specific queries that ask for e.g. all persons participating in some reported agressive incident in the role of AgentCaseRole or PatientCaseRole. In other words: ultimately it allows to specify whether a) some PatientInCare hit a Caregiver or b.) some Caregiver hit a PatientIncare or c) some PatientInCare hit another PatientInCare.

Case roles are semantic roles played by participants of an event, process or situation. Note that the use of case roles is fully optional but allows for finegrained data retrieval on event participants.

Our definition of case roles follows the theory of the linguist Charles Fillmore. In short, case roles describe what role some entity plays in an event,  e.g. if it is doing something, undergoing something or using something. In this ontology, we use case role as a specification of the general role Participant.

For example, in the sentence 'Mary hit John with vase', we have three participants: Mary, John and a vase. With case roles, you can specify the semantic role of the participants:  'Mary' is the Agent, 'John' the Patient and 'the vase' the Theme.

Having case roles for participants of an event allows for specific queries that ask for e.g. all persons participating in some reported agressive incident in the role of AgentCaseRole or PatientCaseRole. In other words: ultimately it allows to specify whether a) some PatientInCare hit a Caregiver or b.) some Caregiver hit a PatientIncare or c) some PatientInCare hit another PatientInCare.

For example 'driving his car to Amsterdam' consist of different temporal parts or phases: driving his car at time 1, 2 and 3. As such, the driving accumulates temporal parts while the driving at time 1 and 2 are no longer present at time 3.

In onz-g, Perdurants are further specialized into EventivePerdurant and StativePerdurant following the modeling approach in DOLCE.  The difference can be explained and illustrated as follows:

-A perdurant is considered an EventivePerdurant if it is cumulative: 'selling this car at time 1' and 'selling this car at time 2 implies two different sellings.

-A perdurant  is considered a StativePerdurant if it is not cumulative: 'owning this car at time 1' and 'owning this car at time 2' does result in one owning a car and not two. 

Note that expressions in Natural Language that relate to Perdurants show different complementation and aspectual structures that indicate whether some expression is to be understood as e.g. an EventivePerdurant or a StativePerdurant. For example: 'John is driving his car' would be considered a Process while 'John drove his car to Amsterdam' would indicate an EventivePerdurant. In onz-g, we deliberately abstract over these distinctions and realizations in Natural Language. As a rule of thumb, we define a class such as onz-g:Translocation as a subclass of EventivePerdurant since we consider translocations (e.g. drive, fly, walk)  to be intrinsically cumulative.'	'As a more straightforward explanation: Perdurants are things that happen such as 'stitching a wound' and  'hiring a registered nurse'. If the thing that is happening has always and intrinsically a result or leads to some change in the world, it is likely to be an EventivePerdurant. If there is no clear result or change in the world  other than not happening at all, it is likely to be a StativePerdurant.

For example:

-What will always be the case if some [Perdurant] happened?

Buying. Result: always implies a change of ownership. Thus: EventivePerdurant.
Kill. Result: always implies that someone died. Thus: EventivePerdurant.
Increase: Result: always implies that there is more of something than before. Thus: EventivePerdurant.

Sleep. No clear result other than not sleeping, no clear change in the world. Thus: StativePerdurant.
Meet. No clear result other than not meeting, no clear change in the world. Thus: StativePerdurant.
Cry. No clear result other than not crying, no clear change in the world.

In the case of a data property, we would say someting like :

DataPropertyRange (onz-g:hasWeight xsd:integer)

The use of the 'hasWeight' dataproperty has now been restricted by defining a specific domain and range.

This approach hampers a.)  interoperabilty across different models and b.) the annotation of heterogeneous data.
 
With reification via QualityValues, we make the shared conceptualization of Weight explicit. With this, we can say that Person has quality Weight and that Weight has a MassValue. The data value of this MassValue is '54'. 

Also, the ontology provides units of measure that allow to define that '54' uses 'kilo' as unit of measure. If another person has the same MassValue of 54 but measured in 'stone', we know that we are still talking about a MassValue but the difference in UnitOfMeasure indicates that the two '54' data values point at a different weight.
